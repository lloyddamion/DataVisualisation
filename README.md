# DataVisualisation
 
The Prosper Loan dataset contains 113,937 loans with 81 variables on each loan, including loan amount, borrower rate (or interest rate), current loan status, borrower income, and many others.

Prosper uses a proprietary system to evaluate applicants consistently. Investors also use it to decide whether to commit to invest in a given loan.
Prosper assigns the loan applicant a rating. It determines the interest rate that they will pay for their loan. Ratings range from AA, for the highest grade, then A, B, C, D, E, and HR for the lowest.
This rating system was introduced for loans that originated after 2009. Therfore for this analysis I'll be only focusing on data that has a Prosper rating captured against it.
